Projects let you group related meetings and give the AI extra context to improve summaries and action extraction. Create a project for anything that groups meetings together — for example a recurring monthly review, a product workstream, or a small cross‑team initiative.

<Info>
	A project is a lightweight container for meetings and a short description of
	what the project is about. The description is used by the AI whenever you
	generate meeting notes for meetings assigned to that project.
</Info>

## Why use projects

Projects provide three main benefits:

- Consistency: every meeting under the same project draws from the same high‑level context, so summaries and action items stay aligned across sessions.
- Organisation: group recurring meetings (e.g. "Monthly Ops"), sprints or topic‑based discussions so they’re easier to find later.
- Better AI output: a short project description helps the AI understand the background and produce more relevant summaries and suggested actions.

## When to create a project

- Recurring meetings (monthly review, weekly standup).
- Any collection of meetings that share a topic or goal (product roadmap, onboarding series).
- When you want a persistent place to store context, links and notes that the AI should consider for every meeting in that group.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new project">
	From the Meeting Notes app, click **New Project**.

    <Check>
    You can see a form to enter a project name and short description.
    </Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Fill in the details">
Provide a clear, concise description (1–3 sentences) that explains the purpose and scope of the project.

<Note>
	Keep descriptions factual and focused — avoid pasting sensitive data. The AI
	will use this text as part of the meeting summarisation input.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Save the project">
Click **Create**. You can now create meetings from this project or assign existing meetings to it.

## Creating a meeting from a project (recommended)

If you create a meeting while viewing a project, the meeting is automatically assigned to that project.

## Assigning an existing meeting to a project

1. Open the meeting you want to assign.
2. At the top, you will see a dropdown of the projects. Select the desired project.

<Info>
	After assigning, when you generate or regenerate the meeting notes, the AI
	will incorporate the project description to enhance the output.
