A big part of our day is consumed by writing up notes from in-person meetings. The [Meeting Notes app](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/meeting-notes) attempts to streamline this process by providing a simple way to transcribe meetings, capture notes and use AI to extract key insights and action items automatically.

<Info>
	We don't record the actual audio of your meetings. The app uses real-time
	speech-to-text transcription to convert spoken words into text, which is then
	processed by the AI to generate summaries and action items. This approach
	ensures that sensitive audio data is not stored, enhancing privacy while still
	leveraging AI capabilities.

	<Card title='Meeting preparation' icon='clipboard-list'>
		Plan your meeting structure in advance and inform attendees about recording.
		This ensures better quality recordings and more accurate AI processing.
	</Card>
	<Card title='Transcription Quality' icon='microphone'>
		For the transcription to be as accurate as possible, the audio quality and
		microphone placement should be optimal. Think about the distance from the
		speaker to the microphone and minimise background noise.
	</Card>
	<Card title='Action items' icon='check-circle'>
		All AI actions will be tagged so you know which items were generated by the
		AI. Feel free to remove ones that are not relevant.
	</Card>
	<Card title='Privacy considerations' icon='shield'>
		Only record meetings where all participants have consented. Be mindful of
		sensitive discussions that shouldn't be recorded. The recording can be
		paused and then resumed for such instances.
