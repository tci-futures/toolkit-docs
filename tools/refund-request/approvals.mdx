## Overview

High-value refund requests require approval to ensure proper oversight and maintain financial controls. The Refund Request App automatically routes queries to the appropriate approvers based on the refund amount.

<Info>
	The approval process is fully managed within the app, providing transparency
	and accountability for all stakeholders.
</Info>

## Approval thresholds

The system uses two key thresholds to determine the approval workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="£2,000 - £9,999" icon="user-check">
  **Manager approval required**
  
  Your line manager must review and approve the refund before the accounts team can process it.
</Card>

<Card title="£10,000+" icon="shield-check">
  **Manager and compliance approval required**
  
  Both your manager and the compliance team must approve the refund, ensuring dual oversight of high-value transactions.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
	Refund requests under £2,000 do not require approval and proceed directly to
	the accounts team for processing. Your manager is still notified for
	visibility.
</Note>

## For refund requesters

### When your request needs approval

You'll be notified via email when your refund request requires approval. The status in "All Queries" will show as "Pending approval".

<Steps>
<Step title="Submit your request">
  Complete and submit the refund request form as normal.
</Step>

<Step title='Automatic routing'>
	The system automatically notifies the required approvers based on the refund
	amount: - £2,000 - £9,999: Your manager is notified - £10,000+: Your manager
	and compliance are notified
</Step>

<Step title='Track approval progress'>
	Monitor the approval status in the "All Queries" section. You'll see who needs
	to approve and the current stage.
	<Tip>
		If approval is taking longer than expected, you can contact your manager or
		compliance directly to follow up.
	</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Receive confirmation">
  Once all required approvals are granted, you'll receive an email notification and the accounts team will begin processing.
  
  <Check>
  The query status will update to "Approved" and then "In progress" as the accounts team works on it.
  </Check>
</Step>
