## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between a transaction reference and a client reference?" icon="circle-question">
  The **transaction reference** is a unique identifier for a specific financial transaction within the system. The **client reference** is a broader identifier for the client's account.
  
  <Warning>
  Always use the transaction reference when submitting refund requests. Using the client reference will cause processing delays.
  </Warning>
  
  If you're unsure which reference to use, contact the accounts team before submitting.
