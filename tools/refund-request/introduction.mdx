The app automatically routes refund requests based on their value:

| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Under £2,000    | Manager notified              | No                            |
| £2,000 - £9,999 | Manager notified              | Manager approval              |
| £10,000+        | Manager & compliance notified | Manager & compliance approval |

<Warning>
	Refund requests over £2,000 require manager approval before processing.
