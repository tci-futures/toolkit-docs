## Overview

The Refund Request App streamlines the process of requesting client refunds from the accounts team. Submit refund queries directly through the app, track their progress in real-time, and maintain clear communication across the organisation.

<Info>
	All refund requests are automatically routed to the accounts team, with
	high-value requests triggering manager and compliance approval workflows.

## Examples and guidance

Some common circumstances to help you choose the correct refund method and provide the necessary details:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Bank transfers" icon="file-invoice">
		If a client paid by bank transfer, their bank details will usually be available in our online banking. If details are missing, contact the client directly to obtain their bank details.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Card refunds" icon="envelope">
		If the refund should go back to the client's card, choose the card option and confirm the last three digits of the card stored on Acturis. If you need help locating this information, please contact us.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Cheque refunds" icon="file-invoice">
		If the client wants a refund by cheque, remember to store the accompanying letter in the electronic file for completeness.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Premium Credit" icon="chart-line">
		If the client pays via Premium Credit and the refund is applicable to that agreement, arrange the refund via the Premium Credit facility or your Premium Credit contact. If the agreement has been paid up, choose the bank transfer option — the client's bank details should be available on the Premium Credit website.

## Approval thresholds

The app automatically routes refund requests based on their value:

| Refund amount   | Notification                  | Approval required             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Under £2,000    | Manager notified              | No                            |
| £2,000 - £9,999 | Manager notified              | Manager approval              |
| £10,000+        | Manager & compliance notified | Manager & compliance approval |

<Warning>
	Refund requests over £2,000 require manager approval before processing.

## Submitting and updating queries

You can submit or update a refund query at any time — including when you're waiting on the insurer. If a query is awaiting insurer action, it's your responsibility to return to the app and update the query with any new information or status changes so the accounts team has the latest details.
