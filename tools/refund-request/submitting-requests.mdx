		transaction reference.

		team process your request quickly.

## After submission

### Confirmation email

You'll receive a confirmation email containing:

- Refund query reference number
- Transaction details you submitted
- Acturis reference number
- Current status

<Tip>
	Add the Acturis reference to the client record using the Acturis Outlook
	plugin to maintain accurate records.
</Tip>

### Approval process

Depending on the refund amount, your request may require approval:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Under £2,000">
  Your manager will be notified, but no approval is required. The accounts team will process your request directly.
</Tab>

<Tab title='£2,000 - £9,999'>
	Your manager must approve the refund before the accounts team can process it.
	You'll be notified once approval is granted.
</Tab>

<Tab title="£10,000+">
  Both your manager and the compliance team must approve the refund. This ensures proper oversight of high-value transactions.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multiple transactions

If you need to refund multiple transactions for the same client:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why submit multiple forms?">
  Each transaction reference must be processed separately by the accounts team. Submitting individual forms ensures accurate tracking and processing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to handle multiple submissions efficiently">
  1. Complete the first refund request form
  2. Submit and wait for confirmation
  3. Return to the Refund Request App
  4. Submit a new form for the next transaction reference
  5. Repeat for each transaction
  
  <Note>
  Your manager selection will be remembered, so you won't need to choose them again for subsequent submissions.
