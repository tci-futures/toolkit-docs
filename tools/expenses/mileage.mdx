## Overview

Use this page to create and manage mileage claims. The Mileage form captures journey details and calculates the total claim automatically. When you submit a journey it sends the claim straight to your manager for approval.

<Info>
	Add your vehicles on the Settings page so they appear in the Vehicle dropdown
	on the Mileage form.
</Info>

## Before you start

- Sign in to the Toolkit and open [Expenses → Mileage](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/finance/expenses/journeys).
- Add your vehicle(s) on [Settings → Vehicles](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/finance/expenses/settings) so they appear in the form.

## Fill in the [Mileage form](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/finance/expenses/journeys)

The form collects the following information:

- Date — date of the journey
- Vehicle — select one of your registered vehicles
- Start Location — where the journey started
- Finish Location — where the journey finished
- Purpose — short description of the journey
- Return Journey — toggle if the journey is return (system doubles single-way miles automatically)
- Miles (one-way) — either calculated using Google Maps or entered manually
- Passengers — number of passengers (the system adds 5p per mile per passenger, up to the allowed maximum)

<Tip>
	The form is optimised for step-by-step journeys. If you have multiple legs,
	use "Submit & Add Next Stop" to create the next leg quickly.
</Tip>

## Convenience features

- Submit & Add Next Stop: when you click this button the form saves the current journey and keeps key values (for example the finish location becomes the next start location). This makes adding multi-leg trips faster. The current leg is submitted to your manager immediately.
- Calculate Journey: click the Calculate Route button to use Google Maps to compute the miles between the start and finish locations. You can override the calculated miles if it's incorrect — but always make sure the final value is accurate.
- Reuse values: after submitting a journey a small box appears allowing you to reuse the recent values for a new claim to speed entry.

## Return journeys and passengers

- Return journeys are calculated automatically. Enter the one-way miles; if the Return Journey toggle is set the system doubles the miles for the claim.
- Passenger adjustments are applied by the system. The app adds the configured per‑passenger amount (for example 5p per mile) up to the organisation's passenger limit. The total is calculated automatically and cannot be edited by users.

<Warning>
	If the total looks incorrect, do not edit the calculated total — contact
	Support using the support button at the top of the site and include the
	journey date and details.
</Warning>

## Submitting and manager approval

- When you submit a journey it immediately appears in the "Waiting for Manager Approval" box on the right of the page and is sent to your manager.
- You can still edit a journey after submission while it’s waiting for manager approval. If you update it, the manager will see the new values.
- Once your manager approves a journey it becomes final and cannot be updated. If you realise a mistake after approval, contact your manager or Finance to rectify it.

<Note>
	Submissions are timestamped; changes after approval require manual
	intervention from Finance.
</Note>

## Totals and allowances

- The page shows the total miles you've claimed in the current financial year. Use this to track your progress against the typical 10,000 mile allowance.
- The total miles and total claim amount are calculated automatically and shown on the page header for quick reference.

## Previous journeys

At the bottom of the page you can review previous journeys regardless of status (Draft, Waiting for Manager Approval, Approved, Rejected). Use this list to copy details from an earlier trip or to check past claims.

## Edge cases and helpful guidance

- If Google Maps cannot calculate a route, enter miles manually and add a short note explaining the reason.
- For multi-leg journeys that include mileage on public transport or taxi legs, record mileage for the vehicle legs only and add relevant receipts for the other legs as Personal or Card expenses.
- If you frequently repeat a journey, use the reuse box to speed up entry.
