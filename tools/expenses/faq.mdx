## Mobile access

<Info>

Mobile access is available only to staff using company-issued mobile phones.

</Info>

If you're using a company mobile device you can sign in to the toolkit with your Microsoft account (the same account used for other Microsoft services). The Expenses app is optimised for desktop and is best viewed on a laptop or desktop screen, but the mobile view is available and useful for quick actions.

- Upload receipts: On mobile you can upload receipts directly to the Expenses app which is much quicker than emailing receipts to yourself. This saves time and keeps your receipts linked to the correct expense.
- Microsoft Lens: We recommend using Microsoft Lens (mobile app) to scan paper receipts — it creates clear images and can save directly to your OneDrive. If you save receipts to your OneDrive, they'll be available from any device and can be attached or referenced from the Expenses app as needed.

If you have trouble signing in or uploading from a mobile device, contact the Accounts Team or Mike Rudge for technical support.

## What if my receipt is only in an email (.eml or .msg)?

If a vendor sends the receipt or invoice in the body of an email (for example, Booking.com) and there’s no PDF or image attachment, convert the email to a PDF and upload that file. The Expenses app does not accept raw `.eml` or `.msg` email files.

How to create a PDF from an email (common approaches):

- Open the email, choose File → Print, select “Microsoft Print to PDF” as the printer, click Print, then save the PDF.

After creating the PDF, upload it on the Statements page like any other receipt and match it to the statement line.

## I am seeing colleagues who have left the company in the app

If you see colleagues who have left the company still listed in the Expenses app, please contact IT support to have their access reviewed and updated. We may need to keep their accounts live for a period of time while we deal with any outstanding expenses or reimbursements.

## Multiple receipts and statement line items

There are two common scenarios when matching receipts to bank or card statement lines.

### Scenario A — several receipts match one statement line

When multiple receipts relate to a single statement line (for example, several small purchases that the card issuer combined into one charge), merge the receipts into one PDF and upload that single file to the statement line.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a merged PDF">
	Merge the individual receipt PDFs into one file before uploading. To do this you can use our [Merge PDFs](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/pdf-converter/merge) tool or, if you prefer to do it manually, you can use PDF editing software to combine the files.
	
</Step>

<Step title="Update the Expenses entry">
	After attaching the merged file, update the amount and the date of the receipt so they match the statement line exactly. This ensures the line reconciles correctly.
	
</Step>
</Steps>

### Scenario B — one receipt matches several statement lines

If a single receipt file covers multiple statement line items (for example, a single PDF with several invoices or a multi-page invoice covering multiple charges), you have two options:

<Steps>
<Step title="Split the PDF into separate pages/files">
	Split the multi-page PDF so each statement line has its own PDF page/file. You can do this using our [Split PDFs](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/pdf-converter/split) tool. Upload each resulting PDF to the corresponding statement line.
	
</Step>

<Step title='Or: upload the same file multiple times'>
	If you prefer, you can attach the same receipt file to each relevant statement
	line by uploading it multiple times and matching each upload to the
	appropriate line.
	<Warning>
		Splitting the PDF is usually clearer for reviewers. Uploading the same file
		multiple times is acceptable if splitting is not possible, but ensure you
		label or note which part of the receipt relates to which statement line when
		you add any comments.
	</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Final verification">
	For every line you attach a receipt to, make sure the amount and date in the Expenses app match the statement line. This is the final step before submission or approval.
	<Check>
	Verify each matched line shows the statement amount and date in the app, and that the correct receipt file is attached.
	</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
	You can use the Merge and Split PDF tools on tools.tcifutures at any time for
	other PDF tasks — they are not limited to expenses. Use them whenever you need
	a quick, reliable way to combine or divide PDFs.
</Tip>

## What if I have lost my receipt?

If you have lost a receipt, follow the process for unreconcilable statement lines as described in the [Matching Receipts to Statement Lines](card-holder#unreconcilable-statement-lines) section of the Managers guide.

## Who do I contact for help with the Expenses App?
