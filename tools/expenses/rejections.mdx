## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open rejected expenses">
    Click the **View Expenses** button in the banner to see the list of rejected expense cards.
    <Check>
      You see the rejected expenses that require your review.
    </Check>
  </Step>

<Step title='Review each expense'>
	For each card: - Read the rejected reason. - Check the amount, receipt and
	notes. - Look for obvious problems such as duplicate receipts or an incorrect
	total.
</Step>

  <Step title="Fix the issue and resubmit">
    Edit the fields on the expense card to correct the mistake. Common fixes:
    - Update the amount if it was entered incorrectly.
    - Add or clarify notes to explain the spend.

    After you finish, click the green checkmark on the card to resubmit the expense to your manager or finance team for approval.

    <Check>
      The expense is sent back into the approval workflow. Wait for the manager or finance team to approve it.
    </Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive duplicates">
    If an expense is a duplicate, archive it instead of resubmitting. Click the archive (trash) icon on the expense card to remove it from your active list while keeping it in the system for records.

    <Tip>
      Archive duplicates only when you are sure the expense is a true duplicate. Archiving keeps the record for audit purposes.
    </Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No rejected reason shown">
    <Note>
      If a card shows "No Rejected Reason Found", carefully check the amount and notes for obvious issues. If nothing is apparent, contact your manager or the finance team and include the expense ID shown on the card.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disagree with the rejection or cannot fix it">
    If you believe the expense was rejected in error or you cannot resolve it, contact your manager or finance. Provide the expense ID, receipts and a brief explanation of why you think the expense is valid.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

- Always verify receipts and totals before resubmitting.
- Include the expense ID when asking for help — it speeds up investigations.

<Warning>
	Resubmitting sends the expense back into the approval workflow. Only resubmit
	once you have corrected the issue.
</Warning>

<Check>
	You have reviewed, corrected or archived the rejected expenses and returned
	valid items to the approval flow.
