<Info>
	Assign a budget code to every expense so finance can allocate costs correctly.
	The system may suggest a code for you, but you should always double‑check the
	choice.
</Info>

## Quick rules

- Assign one budget code per expense.
- If the system suggests a code, verify it before submitting.
- Use the info icon next to each code to see guidance on when to use it.

- Hover the info (i) icon beside a budget code to read a short description of when to use that code.
- You can ask the AI for a recommended code, but treat its suggestion as tentative — the AI can be helpful but may be incorrect.

<Warning>
	Finance will review and correct budget codes if necessary, but assigning the
	most accurate code yourself speeds up processing and reduces back‑and‑forth.
</Warning>

<Check>
	You have assigned or verified a budget code for each expense before
	submission.
