## Overview

As a manager you review and approve your team's expenses. This page explains how notifications work, how expenses are presented to you, what checks the app performs, and the correct way to approve or reject items.

<Info>
	Managers see every employee who has selected them as their manager. For each
	person the app shows expenses waiting for manager approval, grouped by expense
	type: Mileage, Credit Card and Personal.
</Info>

## Notifications

By default you receive "Smart Notifications" roughly daily when there are expenses that need your attention. Smart Notifications are designed to surface only the employees or expense groups that have new items.

If you turn Smart Notifications off in Settings, you will still receive the monthly reminder email but not the daily notifications. Use Settings to manage the cadence that suits you.

<Tip>
	If you manage a large team, turning off daily notifications and relying on the
	monthly reminder can reduce noise. Consider leaving Smart Notifications
	enabled if you prefer real-time oversight.
</Tip>

## Before you start

- Sign in to the Toolkit and open the Expenses app.
- Confirm you are listed as a manager for the employees you expect to review.
- Have your organisation's expense policy to hand so you can check budgets and allowable items.

## How expenses are presented

When you open the Approvals view you’ll see an employee card for each person who has selected you as their manager. Inside each employee card the expenses are grouped by type:

- Mileage — journeys claimed by the employee
- Credit Card — card-holder statements and matched receipts
- Personal — out-of-pocket expenses submitted by the employee

Each group lists the expenses waiting for your review. The app highlights potential issues to help you spot problems quickly (see "Automatic checks" below).

## Review checklist (what you must check)

Always inspect each submitted expense before approving. At minimum, check:

1. Dates — confirm the expense date(s) fall within the reporting period and match the event or travel dates.
2. Amounts — ensure the amount matches the receipt or statement line and is reasonable for the purpose claimed.
3. Purpose — verify the description and any attached notes explain what the expense was for.
4. Receipts — confirm a receipt or proof is attached when required by policy.

These checks help keep the organisation compliant and avoid accidental approvals of incorrect or fraudulent claims.

<Warning>
	Do not simply approve everything in bulk without reviewing individual items.
	Bulk approving without due diligence can lead to compliance issues.
</Warning>

## Approving expenses

You can approve expenses per type within an employee card. For example, to approve all the Mileage items for an employee, open the Mileage group and click the check mark next to that group or each line as needed.

<Check>
	When you approve items they move on to Finance for validation and are removed
	from your pending list.
</Check>

Tip: approving per group is a quick way to clear items after you’ve reviewed every line in that group. Use the per-line check marks when you need granular control.

## Rejecting expenses

You cannot reject expenses in bulk. If an expense is not acceptable you must reject it individually and provide a reason. The employee will see the rejection in their Rejected page, make the necessary changes, and resubmit the expense back to you.

When rejecting:

- Select the individual expense.
- Choose Reject and enter a clear reason explaining what’s wrong and what the employee should change (for example: "Missing VAT receipt" or "Date appears outside claimed trip").

Clear rejection reasons speed up corrections and reduce repeated back-and-forth.

## Automatic checks and highlights

The app assists managers by flagging potential problems:

- Expenses older than 90 days are highlighted in red to indicate they may be out of policy.
- Receipt amounts that don’t match statement or claimed amounts are highlighted in red.
- Missing receipts or unusually large amounts are surfaced for closer inspection.

These visual cues are there to draw your attention — they do not replace your judgement. Investigate any red items before approving.

<Note>
	An item highlighted in red is not automatically rejected; it simply needs your
	review and confirmation.
</Note>

## Edge cases and guidance

- Multiple receipts for one statement line: if the employee has merged or uploaded combined receipts, check that the total equals the statement line before approving.
- One receipt for multiple statement lines: confirm how the employee split the claim and whether the supporting documentation clearly shows allocation between lines.
- No suggested receipt for a statement line: ask the employee to search by date or amount or upload the missing receipt.

## Quick troubleshooting

- Missing employee from your approvals list — check that the employee has you selected as their manager in their profile.
- No suggested receipts — ask the employee to upload or correct the receipt, and confirm the date/amount are accurate.
- Notifications not arriving — check your Smart Notifications setting in Settings; if disabled you'll only get the monthly reminder email.

</Step>

<Step title="Provide rejection reason">

    <Check>
    Rejected expenses appear in the employee's Rejected page for correction and resubmission.

## Final note

We’ve designed the Approvals view to make it quick to see and approve expenses, but it is important you remain diligent. Approving without checking increases the risk of non‑compliance.

If you need further help, contact Accounts or your Finance team with the employee name and statement/expense date.
