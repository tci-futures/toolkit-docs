The [Expenses app](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/finance/expenses) exists because our previous expense process was slow, inconsistent and placed a heavy administrative burden on the Accounts Team and colleagues across the business.

## Why we built the Expenses app

The previous expense process relied on emails and ad-hoc messages. That meant Accounts were constantly chasing missing receipts and spending hours reconciling transactions. It also led to inconsistent submissions across the business.

<Note>
	We built the app to reduce manual work, remove inconsistency and give everyone
	a single, reliable way to submit and approve expenses.
</Note>

## What the system does for you

You can use the app to submit mileage, personal expenses and credit-card holder claims through a single workflow. The system is designed to reduce data entry, speed approvals and give Accounts a clean export for Sage.

- **Single, consistent workflow** — Everyone uses the same process to submit expenses, so records are standardised and easy to reconcile.
- **AI-powered receipt processing** — Upload receipts or statements and the AI extracts date, amount, merchant and VAT (where present), then attempts smart matching to transactions.
- **Real-time visibility** — See where each expense is: **submitted**, **awaiting approval**, **approved** or **exported**.
- **Flexible manager approvals** — Managers approve when it suits them: ad hoc or at the end of the month.
- **One-click Sage export for Accounts** — Accounts can download a complete, Sage-ready report each month, saving hours of manual preparation.

## How this helps the Accounts Team

The app removes repetitive, tedious tasks from the Accounts Team so they can focus on higher-value work. By enforcing a stricter, consistent process across the business, reconciliation is faster and errors are reduced.
