The Accounts team uploads statements monthly. You’ll receive an email when a new statement is ready. Open the Statements section to view them:

## Before you start

- Sign in to the Toolkit and confirm you are registered as a Card Holder.
- Have receipts or PDFs ready to upload (JPG, PNG, PDF).
- The app uses AI to extract receipt data — always verify extracted details.

## Upload a receipt

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a receipt or invoice">
	On the Statements page, upload an image or PDF of the receipt.

    <Check>
    Upload accepted file types: JPG, PNG, PDF. Processing happens in the background — you can close the app while it runs.
    </Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Confirm extracted details">
	Review the AI-extracted date, merchant and total. Correct any errors before matching.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
	The AI can make mistakes. Always confirm the amount and date before you
	submit.
</Warning>

## Match receipts to statement lines

![statement screen](/images/expenses-statement.png)

1. Open a statement to see its line items.
2. Click a line item to open the match modal.
3. Choose a receipt (the app suggests matches by date and amount).
4. Add notes explaining the expense and select the correct budget code.
5. Edit the receipt if needed (use the pencil icon).

<Check>
	Mark matched receipts as matched. Continue until every line is reconciled.
</Check>

## Unreconcilable statement lines

If you do not have a receipt for a statement line, or cannot find it, you can mark the item as unreconcilable. This is common for corporate charges like bank fees or when a receipt is genuinely lost.

When you click on a statement line, the matching dialog opens. If you cannot select a receipt, click the **Mark as unreconcilable** button.

		alt='Marking a statement line as unreconcilable'
	/>
</Frame>

The system will then ask you for a reason. You must provide a clear explanation for why the receipt is missing.

<Warning>
	Your manager and the Accounts team will review this reason. Be sure to provide
	enough detail for them to approve the expense.
</Warning>

After you provide a reason, the system creates a dummy receipt and automatically matches it to the statement line. The item is then considered reconciled.

## Multiple receipts for one statement line

If a single statement line matches more than one receipt (for example, several small receipts make up one card charge), merge those receipts into a single PDF before uploading. After uploading, update the receipt amount so it equals the total of the statement line.

## One receipt for multiple statement lines

If a single receipt covers multiple statement lines, you have a few options:

- Split the PDF into separate pages and upload each relevant page as a separate file.
- Take screenshots of the parts of the receipt that match each line and upload those images.
- Upload the same file multiple times and match it to each line.

The team know this is an awkward area and we may add a built-in way to split receipts across line items in a future release.

## Email with no PDF attachment

If a vendor sends a receipt or invoice in the body of an email (for example, Booking.com) and there’s no PDF attachment, save the email as a PDF and upload that file. Users cannot upload `.eml` files directly.

How to print an email to PDF:

File → Print → select "Microsoft Print to PDF" and save.

After saving the email as PDF, upload it in the Statements page like any other receipt and match it to the statement line.

## Submit for approval

When all lines are matched or marked unreconcilable, the Submit for Approval button appears. Submitting sends the statement to your manager for review.

## Quick troubleshooting

- Missing Statements section — check your Card Holder setting and refresh the page.
- Incorrect AI extraction — edit the receipt before matching.
- No suggested receipts — search by date or amount, or upload the missing receipt.

If you still need help, contact Accounts or your manager with the statement date and a short description of the problem.
