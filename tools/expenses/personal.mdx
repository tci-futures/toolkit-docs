## Overview

Personal expenses are items you have paid for personally and want reimbursed for. This page explains how to upload receipts, verify the AI‑extracted details, add notes and a budget code, and submit the claim to your manager.

## Before you start

- Sign in to the Toolkit and open [Expenses → Personal](https://tools.tcifutures.co.uk/admin/finance/expenses).
- Have a clear photo or PDF of the receipt or invoice ready (JPG, PNG or PDF).
- Know the appropriate budget code for the expense or consult your manager/Finance if unsure.

## Uploading a receipt

1. Click Add receipt or Upload and choose a photo or PDF of the receipt.
2. The app's AI attempts to extract the merchant, date and total from the receipt automatically.

	The app accepts JPG, PNG and PDF files. Processing happens in the background —
	you can continue working while the AI extracts information.
</Check>

## Verify and correct extracted data

After AI extraction, always verify the details before submitting:

- Date — make sure the date on the receipt is correct.
- Amount — confirm the total matches the receipt. If the AI misread it, update the amount.
- Merchant/description — edit the description or add a clearer merchant name if needed.

<Warning>
	AI extraction is a convenience — it can make mistakes. Always check date and
	amount before submitting for approval.
</Warning>

## Add notes and select a budget code

- Add a short note explaining the purpose of the expense (for example: "Client lunch — project X").
- Choose the correct budget code from the budget code dropdown. If you are unsure which code to pick, ask your manager or Finance.

Clear notes and the correct budget code speed up manager approval and Finance validation.

## Submit for manager approval

- When you are satisfied with the details, click Send to Manager or Submit to send the expense to your manager for approval.
- The expense will appear in your "Waiting for Manager Approval" list and will be visible to the manager.

<Note>
	You can edit the expense while it is waiting for manager approval. Once your
	manager approves the expense it becomes final and cannot be changed without
	Finance intervention.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting and tips

- Missing or unreadable receipt: retake the photo or ask the vendor for a PDF and upload that instead.
- Wrong amount extracted: correct the amount manually before submitting.
- Unsure about the budget code: add a clear note and ask your manager to confirm before approving.
